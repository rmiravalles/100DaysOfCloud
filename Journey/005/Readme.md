# My first look at Terraform

## Introduction

I've always wanted to learn Terraform. I find it one of the most useful tools today. This is my first attempt to deploy resources using Terraform from the Azure Cloud Shell.

## Prerequisite

If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, you don't need to install Terraform. If it's the first time you access the Cloud Shell, you'll have to setup a storage account. Don't worry, it costs you almost nothing.

## Use Case

I'm a newcomer to the game, but it seems to me that Terraform is widely used. I believe it's a tool we should know.

## Cloud Research

- I've started the Terraform on Azure course from Cloudskills and read some docs from Microsoft before actually trying this project.

## Try yourself

For this project, I created a service principal. A service principal is a special identity created for use with applications, services and tools to communicate with Azure resources. You can restrict access by configuring the service principal. This is something I need to study more in depth. I then created a resource group using Terraform and later destroyed it.
