# Starting my journey with Terraform

## Cloud Research

- I finally sat to start studying Terraform.
- I started the Terraform on Azure course from Cloudskills, but just watched the first module.
- I read some documentation from Microsoft Docs and actually started my first project, but didn't really have time to document it properly.
